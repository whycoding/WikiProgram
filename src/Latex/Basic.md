The bundle splits txfonts.sty into two independent packages, newtxtext.sty and newtxmath.sty, 
each with fixes and enhancements.

newtxmathâ€™s metrics have been re-evaluated to provide a less tight appearance, 
and to provide a libertine option that substitutes Libertine italic and Greek letter for the existing math italic and Greek glyphs, 
making a mathematics package that matches Libertine text quite well.

newtxmath can also use the maths italic font provided with the garamondx package, 
thus offering a garamond-alike text-with-maths combination.
